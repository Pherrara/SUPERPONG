Just a fun project I worked on a year or so ago and decided to upload on github.

It's my take on "Pong", the virst video game ever created.
The ball's speed increase at every hit, but every time the paddle hit the ball, the former is recoiled in the opposite direction, the amount of impulse transferred is proportional to the speed of the ball, you can loose if your paddle is recoiled against the wall.
There's another dimension of gameplay added by the possibility of horizontal movement, that's valuable for a more offensive playstile but also for contrasting recoil.
